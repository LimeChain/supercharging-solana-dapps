### 5. Testing the initialize of the wallet

<img src="./assets/images/test-initialize.png" width="70%" alt="Test Program"/>

1. We need to build the wallet PDA from seed using 3 components:

   <img src="./assets/images/from-seed.png" width="20%" alt="Seed"/>

   - Seed string that we used in our code "wallet"

     <img src="./assets/images/string-seed.png" width="20%" alt="Insert String Seed"/>

   - The owner public key

     <img src="./assets/images/key-seed.png" width="20%" alt="Insert Owner Public Key"/>

   - The program ID - (automatically passed)

     <img src="./assets/images/pda-generate.png" width="20%" alt="PDA Generate"/>

2. We can test our initialize wallet function with pressing the test button.

### 6. Deposit SOL

<img src="./assets/images/deposit.png" width="40%" alt="Deposit SOL"/>

1. We can deposit 0.1 SOL. Please note that we are using lampports.
2. We can press the test button:

   <img src="./assets/images/deposit-successfull.png" width="40%" alt="Deposit Successful"/>

### 7. Withdraw SOL

<img src="./assets/images/withdraw.png" width="40%" alt="Withdraw SOL"/>

1. We can withdraw the SOL amount similarly as we deposited it.
2. The wallet ID that we need to pass it the same PDA that we've derived in step 5:

   <img src="./assets/images/withdraw-successfull.png" width="50%" alt="Withdraw Successful"/>

### 8. Close Wallet

<img src="./assets/images/close.png" width="40%" alt="Close Wallet"/>

1. We can close the account.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. "Too Early" Error

- Occurs when trying to withdraw before release time
- Solution: Wait until release time or create new wallet with shorter timelock

### 2. Account Already Exists

- Occurs when creating a wallet that already exists
- Solution: Close existing wallet first or use different address

### 3. Insufficient Balance

- Occurs when lacking SOL for rent or deposit
- Solution: Fund your wallet with devnet SOL

## Complete Testing Flow

1. Create wallet (5-min lock)
2. Deposit 0.1 SOL
3. Try withdraw (fails)
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Withdraw (succeeds)
6. Close wallet
